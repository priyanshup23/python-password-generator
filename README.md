this is very simple python program which generates the password and stores that generated password in the password history file with the date and time when that particular password is generated.

how it works:

there will be two commands:
1. gen => to generate the new password and that will be stored in history file
	=> and enter the length for your password.
	=> and your password is generated
2. hist => this is to see the history of passwords you generated

password generating:
=> must have to enter length of password greater than 8.
=> the password is generated with the help of random module and random.shuffle()
